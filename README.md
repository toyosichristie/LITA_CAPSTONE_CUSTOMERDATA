  The primary source of data is Customerdata. xlsx. This is a data given as capstone project in partial fulfillment of A 3-month Data Analysis training with Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA), the Incubator Hub.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  
    1. Data cleaning
  
    2. Analysis
  
    3. Visualisation
       
- SQL- Structured Querying Language for Querying of Data.
- Power BI for Data Visualisation.
- GitHub for Portfolio Building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
  At the initial stage of Data cleaning and preparation,the following actions were performed
  
    1. Data loading and Inspection
    
    2. Handling missing variables
    
    3. Removing duplicates
    
    4. Data cleaning and formatting

### Explanatory Data Analysis
      Explanatory Data Analysis involved exploring the data to answer some questions such as:

- Analyse customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
- Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular subscription types.
- Write SQL queries to extract key insights.
- Create a Power BI dashboard that visualises the insights found in Excel and SQL.
